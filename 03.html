        <h3> Flutter and web development</h3>
    <p> During the keynote of Google Developer Days in Shanghai in September 2018, Google announced 
        Flutter Release Preview 2, the last major     release before Flutter 1.0. On December 4th of 
        that year, Flutter 1.0 was released at the Flutter Live event, denoting the first stable version 
        of the framework. On December 11, 2019, Flutter 1.12 was released at the Flutter Interactive 
        event.[10] On March 3, 2021, Google released Flutter 2 during an online Flutter Engage event. 
        This major update brought official support for web-based applications with a new Canvas Kit 
        renderer and web specific widgets, early-access desktop application support for Windows, macOS, 
        and Linux and improved Add-to-App APIs.[11] This release also utilized Dart 2.0 that featured 
        sound null-safety, which caused many breaking changes and issues with many external packages; 
        however, the Flutter team included instructions and tools to mitigate these issues.[12]</p><br>

           An average Fortune 500 company makes 400 million decisionsper day. These decisions are made in a rapidly changing and complex 
           global environment, yet oftentimes they are still based on rules, heuristics and gut feel. Advancements in technology,especially 
           in Data & AI.Many statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name 
           for statistics.[15] Others argue that data science is distinct from statistics because it focuses on problems and techniques 
           unique to digital data.[16] Vasant Dhar writes that statistics emphasizes quantitative data and description. In contrast, data 
           science deals with quantitative and qualitative data (e.g. from images, text, sensors, transactions or customer information etc) 
           and emphasizes prediction and action.[17] Andrew Gelman of Columbia University has described statistics as a nonessential part of 
           data science.[18]
